# project2 -- Calories Calculator

The purpose of this project is to create a Web Dashboard that allows a user to input personal information, and generate food item recommendations based on the Mcdonalds Menu without exceeding the maximum caloric intake of a human. 

There are 4 major parts to this repo:
1) Static Folder: includes the Javascript file "mcd" that contains most of the code, and also a small CSS styles sheet. 
2) Templates Folder: includes all the html pages.
3) APPY.PY: this runs the Flask application that allows connection between the Database & the html pages. 
4) mcds.PY: this demonstrates how you can read in a CSV file into MongoDB via Python.
